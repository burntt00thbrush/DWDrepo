Week1:

Create a simple webpage; perhaps a work of hypertext art, fiction, or poetry, 
put it online with a simple node based HTTP server (Digital Ocean is a good choice). 


You know how sometimes people make projects by collecting and exhibiting old 
post-it notes, napkins, receipts etc. ? These useless but instrically valuable remnants of the self?
This has been my inspiration for my first assignment: a cyber museum of screenshots from my desktop.

Week 2 assignment:

Build a simple Express application which takes in data from a form and outputs the results on an HTML page. An example might be a quote generator or a guestbook but feel free to build something of your own creation.
